# sarfinaz-ai-planner
AI-powered study planner that generates smart learning schedules based on goals.

This project is my personal AI study planner designed to help me prepare for university applications, language learning, and tech skills like Computer Science and AI. It automatically generates customized daily study tasks based on my goals and time availability. Iâ€™m building this to stay consistent, track progress, and showcase my skills in AI and productivity tools as part of my portfolio.
